    "\n",
    "**Paula**, **Sue** and **Daisy** are mathematical geniuses. They can do any number of calculations in their head instantly. One day, they're given the task of figuring out two numbers. Those two numbers are in the range between $1$ and $1000$ (inclusive) and they're whole numbers (no decimal numbers). Both numbers can be the same too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paula is told the product of both numbers (one number multiplied with the other), Sue is told the sum of both numbers and Daisy is told the difference between the two numbers (one number substracted from the other). However, they're not allowed to tell those numbers to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the following conversation ensues:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Paula: I don't know the two numbers.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Sue: You don't need to tell me that, I've known that already.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Paula: Ah, in that case, I know the numbers now.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Sue: Ok, I know the numbers now too.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Daisy: I still don't know the numbers. I can guess one number, which is likely to be one of the two numbers, but I don't know for sure.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Paula: I know which number you're thinking of, but this one is wrong. It's not one of the two numbers.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Daisy: Ah, then I know the numbers now too.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! \n",
    "\n",
    "Believe it or not, it's actually possible to figure out the two numbers. There's several different approaches to solving this, so I cannot give any hints, as one way may be easier for some people but harder for others, and vice versa."
